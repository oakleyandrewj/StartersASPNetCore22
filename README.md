# StartersASPNetCore22
A company 'New Starters' Admin System written in ASP.net Core 2.2

A working skills demo in line with a company new starters record system that I had been maintaining in ASP web forms. I wanted to do the similar on an updated stack.

So , I wanted to use this to explore:

- asp.net core tag helpers for navigation
- EF Core using SQL db (using localDb in Dev)
- Dependency Injection design model
- An attractive bootstrap/JQuery interface
- MS Tests Unit tests in a .net core project
- Identity and Authorisation using .net core

All written in VS from an empty template. Its designed to be forked and ran locally with no server connections or external db.
